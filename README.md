# Crop Yield Forecasting and Prediction

This project aims to explore the multiple variables relating the food price inflation in Rwanda.

## Problem: uncertainty around climate change
1.	Climate change affect agriculture production
2.	Inflation depends on agriculture production

## Objectives:

1.	Taming inflation using meteorological factors affecting agriculture production
2.	Simulation of different scenarios
3.	Forecasting the agriculture production using meteorological data
4.	Prediction of inflation based on agriculture production

## Data source:

1.	Meteorological data.
2.	Agriculture production from Agriculture survey
3.	International data 
1.	WFP
2.	US
3.	EUROZONE

## What have been done:

1.	Gathered all the data (time series)
2.	Data exploration and Cleaning
3.	Preliminary simple correlation analysis

## What we need to achieve:

1.	Get neighboring countries data (EAC)
2.	Get the causal inference from the variables
3.	Explore the dynamics of crop yield
4.	Get the dynamical correlation analysis
